<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>Note sample</td><td>Enter a single clip of a percussion instrument in .mp3 or .wav format (and maybe others, system dependent)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mode</td><td>Enter "XyloFonyX" to use the native song data entry, or "ABC notation" to use the standard ABC format.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Half-steps per octave (default 12)</td><td>Western music typically uses twelve notes (called half-steps) per octave, which means that there are twelve discrete notes required on a piano each time the note frequency doubles.  Other musical traditions use different numbers of notes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Note trim</td><td>The fraction of a note to keep.  Use 1.0 to keep the whole note, or 0.8 to keep the first 80% and cut off the last 20%.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Frequency shift</td><td>Enter a positive number of half-steps to tone-shift the melody higher, or a negative number to shift it lower.  If a zero is entered, then in the XyloFonyX format the WAV/MP3 note supplied will be note 0.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Time between notes</td><td>This value (in seconds) controls the tempo of the melody.  In ABC format, this is the length of the note specified by the L: field.  In the XyloFonyX format, all note lengths are relative to this value.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Invert melody</td><td>Check this box to vertically invert a melody -- every time the note value of the original melody increased, it will decrease now by the same amount.</td>
    </tr>
